    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # default-dataresidency-config is the configuration for determining the default
    # data residency to apply to all objects that require data residency.
    # This is expected to be Channels and Sources and Brokers.
