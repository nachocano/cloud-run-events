Knative with GCP builds on Kubernetes to enable easy configuration and
consumption of Google Cloud Platform events and services. It can be useful
independently, but is best mixed with [Knative](https://knative.dev).

To get started, [install Knative with GCP](./docs/install/README.md).

Then use one of the implemented `Source` resource,

- [Storage (events.cloud.google.com)](docs/storage/README.md)
- [Scheduler (events.cloud.google.com)](docs/scheduler/README.md)

To use a Knative Eventing Channel backed by Pub/Sub:

- [Channel (messaging.cloud.google.com)](docs/channel/README.md)

To leverage Pub/Sub directly, Pub/Sub resources:

- [PullSubscription (pubsub.cloud.google.com)](docs/pullsubscription/README.md)
- [Topic (pubsub.cloud.google.com)](docs/topic/README.md)

_Note:_ This repo is still in development apis and resource names are subject to
change in the future.
